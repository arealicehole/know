Engineering Report: Development of a Low-Cost, Tethered Smart Glass Platform for Continuous Streaming
Executive Summary
The paradigm of wearable computing has historically been bifurcated into two distinct categories: high-cost, proprietary integrated systems (e.g., Google Glass, HoloLens) and low-functionality microcontroller-based novelties. This engineering report explores the feasibility, design, and fabrication of a "Middle Path" architecture: a high-fidelity, open-source smart glass platform constructed for approximately $100 USD. The specific operational requirements—continuous video recording and real-time network streaming—impose severe power and thermal penalties that render fully integrated "wireless" designs impractical within this budget class. Consequently, this research advocates for and details a "Tethered Processing Architecture," where the energy density and thermal mass are offloaded from the cranial frame to a pocket-based unit via a flexible umbilical.
This document serves as a comprehensive technical dossier for systems engineers and hardware enthusiasts. It analyzes the selection of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W as the optimal computational core, superior to microcontroller alternatives like the ESP32 for high-bandwidth H.264 encoding. It details the integration of the Sony IMX708 sensor (Camera Module 3) for autofocus-enabled high-definition imaging and the implementation of I2S MEMS microphones for synchronized audio. Furthermore, it provides an exhaustive software implementation guide utilizing the libcamera stack and MediaMTX for low-latency Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) transmission. The report concludes with a mechanical fabrication guide that circumvents the need for additive manufacturing (3D printing) through the use of modular industrial fasteners and silicone cabling, ensuring the final artifact remains accessible, durable, and cost-effective.
1. Theoretical Framework and Architectural Constraints
The engineering challenge of creating "smart glasses" is fundamentally an exercise in managing the "Wearable Trilemma": the competing constraints of Performance (processing power/sensor quality), Autonomy (battery life), and Ergonomics (weight/thermal comfort). In commercial products retailing for >$300, specialized ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and high-density custom battery chemistries are employed to mitigate these trade-offs. However, within a strictly limited budget of ~$100 1, off-the-shelf components must be utilized, which requires a radical rethinking of the system architecture.
1.1 The Failure of Integrated Architectures in Budget Considerations
Most DIY smart glass projects attempt to emulate the form factor of commercial units like the Ray-Ban Stories or Snap Spectacles, which place the battery, processor, and camera entirely within the frames.1 For a budget build, this approach is fundamentally flawed for several physical and economic reasons:
1. Thermal Throttling: Low-cost processors suitable for video encoding (like the Broadcom BCM2837/RP3A0) generate significant waste heat (approx. 1.8W under load).2 Without the budget for custom heat pipes or magnesium alloy chassis, placing this heat source against the temple results in user discomfort and rapid thermal throttling, reducing frame rates and system stability.3
2. Gravimetric Imbalance: Standard 18650 or flat Li-Po cells offering meaningful capacity (e.g., >2000mAh) are too heavy to mount on eyewear without causing the frames to slide or dig into the nasal bridge. Smaller cells (<300mAh) that fit comfortably offer negligible runtimes (often <45 minutes) for continuous Wi-Fi streaming.1
3. Component Density: Integrating a processor, battery, and camera into a single head-mounted unit requires advanced miniaturization (custom PCBs), which typically exceeds the $100 limit and requires surface-mount soldering skills beyond the average enthusiast.
1.2 The "Corded" or Tethered Architecture Strategy
To satisfy the user requirement for continuous recording and streaming 1, this report proposes a distributed topology, historically referenced in military and industrial wearable computing (e.g., Xybernaut systems of the late 1990s).
The Tethered Topology Defined:
* Head-Mounted Unit (HMU): Contains only the lightweight sensing peripherals—the camera module and the microphone. In some configurations, the ultra-lightweight Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is mounted here if balanced correctly, but the heaviest component—the power source—is strictly removed.
* Body-Worn Unit (BWU): A high-capacity battery bank carried in a pocket.
* The Umbilical: A flexible, durable cable connecting the two.
Advantages of Tethering:
* Infinite Runtime Potential: By decoupling energy storage from the frame, the system can utilize massive 5000mAh or 10,000mAh battery banks.4 This enables runtimes of 8–12 hours, satisfying the "continuous" requirement.1
* Thermal Isolation: Removing the battery charging circuitry from the head eliminates a major heat source.
* Cost Efficiency: Standard USB power banks and cables are commodity items, significantly cheaper per watt-hour than specialized miniature Li-Po cells.4
1.3 Cost Analysis and Feasibility
The strict $100 budget requires ruthless prioritization of components. The "brains" and "eyes" of the system must consume the bulk of the capital, necessitating savings in the chassis and power delivery systems.
Budget Allocation Strategy:
* Compute (20%): A sub-$20 Single Board Computer (SBC).
* Optics (30%): A high-quality camera module ($25–30).
* Connectivity & Audio (15%): Cables, microphones, and adapters.
* Power (20%): Battery bank and regulation.
* Chassis (15%): Mounting materials (tape, clips, straps).
This allocation suggests that a high-performance Linux-based system is feasible if the builder avoids expensive custom enclosures (3D printing services) and utilizes salvage or commodity mounting hardware.5
2. Computational Hardware Selection and Analysis
The core of the smart glass system is the processor responsible for ingesting raw image data, encoding it into a transmission-friendly format (H.264), and packetizing it for network transport. The market offers two primary classes of devices for this: Microcontrollers (MCUs) and Single Board Computers (SBCs).
2.1 Microcontroller Analysis: The ESP32-CAM Limitations
The ESP32-CAM (and the newer ESP32-S3) is a ubiquitous choice for low-cost IoT cameras.6 It is exceptionally cheap (~$10) and integrates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. However, for continuous video streaming, it presents critical bottlenecks:
* Architecture: The Xtensa LX7 dual-core processor lacks a dedicated Video Processing Unit (VPU). Video encoding is done largely in software or via a rudimentary JPEG engine.
* Performance: Benchmarks indicate that the ESP32-CAM struggles to maintain stable framerates at resolutions above QVGA (320x240). At SVGA (800x600) or higher, framerates often drop below 15 FPS, and latency increases significantly.8
* Format: The device typically streams MJPEG (Motion JPEG). This is an inefficient protocol that sends a sequence of full JPEG images. It consumes massive network bandwidth compared to inter-frame compression standards like H.264, leading to network congestion and poor range.8
* Conclusion: While adequate for intermittent snapshots or low-framerate security monitoring, the ESP32 ecosystem is insufficient for a "smart glass" experience requiring fluid, high-definition video and synchronized audio.9
2.2 Single Board Computer Analysis: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is the engineered solution of choice for this project. Released as a successor to the Zero W, it utilizes the RP3A0 system-in-package (SiP), which integrates the Broadcom BCM2710A1 silicon used in the Raspberry Pi 3.11
Technical Superiority:
1. Processor: Quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 @ 1GHz. This offers approximately 5x the multi-threaded performance of the original single-core Zero W.11 This headroom is critical for running the operating system, audio subsystems (ALSA), and networking stack simultaneously without stalling the video pipeline.
2. GPU: The VideoCore IV GPU is the linchpin of this selection. It provides hardware-accelerated H.264 encoding (via the OpenMAX or V4L2 M2M APIs). This allows the CPU to remain relatively idle while the GPU encodes 1080p30 video, ensuring high efficiency and lower thermal output compared to software encoding.12
3. Form Factor: At 65mm x 30mm, it is small enough to be mounted on a headband or the side of a pair of safety glasses.11
4. Connectivity: Integrated 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi (2.4GHz) and Bluetooth 4.2 allow for wireless streaming and potential future integration of Bluetooth peripherals (keyboards, headsets).11
Comparison with Raspberry Pi 4/5:
While the Pi 4 or 5 offers vastly more power, they are too heavy, power-hungry, and thermally aggressive for a head-mounted application. Even in a tethered setup where the Pi is in the pocket, the thick HDMI and CSI cables required to run sensors up to the head would be cumbersome (the "thick cable" problem). The Zero 2 W strikes the optimal balance: light enough to head-mount the computer itself, requiring only a thin USB power cable to run to the pocket.13
2.3 Memory and Storage Considerations
The Zero 2 W is limited to 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM.11 This is a tight constraint for a modern Linux system.
* Implication: A desktop environment (GUI) is non-viable. The system must run "headless" (Lite OS), utilizing command-line interfaces and optimized daemons for streaming.
* Storage: A high-endurance MicroSD card is required. Since the device acts as a body cam with continuous recording 14, the write cycles will be high. An "Application Class" (A1 or A2) card from a reputable vendor (SanDisk High Endurance or Samsung PRO Endurance) is recommended to prevent corruption during power loss or high-bitrate writing.15
3. Optical Sensor Integration
The "eyes" of the smart glasses determine the utility of the recorded footage. In the $100 price bracket, the optical quality must balance resolution, light sensitivity, and focusing capability.
3.1 Sensor Selection: Camera Module 3
The Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 16 is the recommended sensor, utilizing the Sony IMX708.
Technical Specifications:
* Resolution: 12 Megapixels (4608 x 2592).
* Focus: Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF). This is a game-changer for smart glasses. Previous fixed-focus modules (Module v2) struggled with the variance between reading a document (near field) and looking at scenery (infinity). The PDAF system allows the Module 3 to rapidly adjust focus, mimicking the accommodation of the human eye.16
* HDR (High Dynamic Range): The sensor supports HDR, which is vital for wearable use where lighting conditions change abruptly (e.g., walking from indoors to bright sunlight). HDR prevents the "blown out" white skies or pitch-black shadows common in cheaper sensors.16
Comparison with "Spy" Cameras:
Cheap "spy camera" modules often use the OmniVision OV2640 or similar ancient sensors. These lack autofocus, have poor dynamic range, and suffer from severe rolling shutter artifacts. The Module 3, while costing ~$25 (25% of budget), provides video quality comparable to mid-range smartphones, justifying the investment for a "pro-grade" DIY project.17
3.2 Field of View (FoV) and Lens Options
The Module 3 is available in standard (75°) and wide (120°) variants.16
* Standard (75°): Closer to the human focused field of view. Better for capturing specific objects, reading text, or facial recognition tasks.
* Wide (120°): Better for "life-logging" or action-camera style footage, capturing the peripheral context.
* Recommendation: For general-purpose smart glasses, the Standard FoV is often superior. Wide-angle lenses introduce significant barrel distortion ("fisheye" effect) which can make text unreadable and objects appear further away than they are. The Standard lens provides a more natural, flatter image suited for streaming and documentation.18
3.3 Interface: The CSI-2 Bus
The camera connects via the Camera Serial Interface (CSI-2), a high-speed differential signaling bus.
* Cable Compatibility: The Pi Zero 2 W uses a smaller "mini" CSI connector compared to the full-sized Pi 4. The Camera Module 3 usually ships with a standard cable.
* Requirement: A Zero-specific camera cable is required.19 These are inexpensive ($5) but essential.
* Signal Integrity: CSI cables are unshielded. In a wearable environment with potential electromagnetic interference (EMI) from the Pi's Wi-Fi radio or the human body, signal integrity can be an issue. It is recommended to keep the cable length under 15cm if possible. If a longer run is needed (e.g., placing the Pi in the pocket and the camera on the head), a specialized HDMI-to-CSI extension kit (ArduCam) would be needed, but this blows the budget and adds bulk. Therefore, the Head-Mounted Unit design (Pi + Camera on head) is the preferred topology for signal integrity.20
4. Acoustic Signal Processing
Audio capture is often an afterthought in DIY projects, yet it is critical for the "smart glass" experience (voice notes, ambient recording). The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W lacks an analog audio input (no 3.5mm jack), necessitating a digital interface solution.
4.1 Interface Analysis: USB vs. I2S
Option A: USB Microphone
* Pros: Plug-and-play compatibility.
* Cons: High CPU overhead (USB polling). Bulky physical connector. High power consumption. Variable latency which causes Audio/Video desynchronization (drift) over time.21
Option B: I2S (Inter-IC Sound) MEMS Microphone
* Pros: Direct hardware interface to the CPU's PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) peripheral. Extremely low CPU usage. Microscopic form factor. High fidelity (low noise floor).
* Cons: Requires soldering and device tree configuration.
Decision: The I2S interface is the professional choice for this application. It allows for the integration of the microphone directly into the chassis without a protruding USB dongle.
4.2 Component Selection: INMP441
The InvenSense INMP441 is an omnidirectional MEMS microphone with a 24-bit I2S interface.22
* Frequency Response: 60Hz to 15kHz, covering the human vocal range effectively.22
* Cost: Approximately $5–6 USD.22
* Pinout & Wiring: The INMP441 connects to the Pi Zero 2 W's GPIO header.
   * SCK (Serial Clock): GPIO 18 (Pin 12) - Provides the timing for bit transmission.
   * WS (Word Select): GPIO 19 (Pin 35) - Toggles between Left and Right channels.
   * SD (Serial Data): GPIO 20 (Pin 38) - The audio data line.
   * VDD: 3.3V (Pin 1). Warning: Connecting to 5V will destroy the MEMS sensor.
   * GND: Ground (Pin 6).
   * L/R: Ground (Selects Left Channel).
This configuration allows the Pi to act as the I2S Master, driving the clock signals that the microphone uses to sample audio.
4.3 Acoustic Mechanical Design
In a wearable context, wind noise is a significant enemy. The MEMS microphone is sensitive to air movement.
* Wind Screening: A small piece of open-cell foam (or even a fragment of a synthetic sponge) placed over the microphone port acts as a windscreen.
* Isolation: The microphone should be mechanically isolated from the rigid frame if possible (using double-sided foam tape) to prevent handling noise (vibrations from touching the glasses) from coupling into the audio stream.
5. Power Systems and Tether Engineering
The "Tethered" architecture relies on the robustness of the power delivery system. A failure here results in immediate system shutdown and potential SD card corruption.
5.1 Power Requirements and Consumption Analysis
* Pi Zero 2 W (Idle): ~0.7W (135mA @ 5.1V).2
* Pi Zero 2 W (Streaming 1080p): ~1.8W (360mA @ 5.1V).2
* Camera Module 3: ~0.25W.
* Total System Draw: ~2.1W to 2.5W.
Current Draw: The system draws roughly 400-500mA at 5V. This is well within the capabilities of standard USB 2.0 ports (500mA) and easily handled by modern power banks (typically 2.1A or 3A output).23
5.2 Battery Bank Selection
Commercial power banks are rated in mAh at the internal cell voltage (3.7V), not the output voltage (5V).
* Calculation: A 5000mAh bank contains $5000mAh \times 3.7V = 18.5Wh$ of energy.
* Efficiency: Assuming 85% efficiency in voltage boost conversion (3.7V to 5V): $18.5Wh \times 0.85 = 15.7Wh$ usable.
* Runtime: $15.7Wh / 2.5W \approx 6.2$ hours of continuous streaming.
Form Factor: A "Slim" style power bank (e.g., Anker 5000mAh Slim or similar) is ideal.4 It is roughly the size of a smartphone and fits unobtrusively in a pocket. This is vastly superior to head-mounted batteries which might last 30 minutes.
5.3 The Umbilical: Cable Engineering
The cable connecting the head unit to the power bank is the most mechanically stressed component. Standard PVC-jacketed USB cables are stiff, transmit mechanical noise (microphonics) to the ear, and become brittle in cold weather.
Material Selection: Silicone Cabling
* Silicone Sheathing: Silicone cables are ultra-flexible and "limp," meaning they do not hold a shape or transmit vibration.25 This is critical for wearer comfort.
* Conductor Gauge: While the current is relatively low (500mA), a cable with 24AWG or thicker power lines is recommended to minimize voltage drop over the 1-meter length. The Pi Zero is sensitive to voltage sag; if the voltage at the GPIO pins drops below 4.63V, the system may become unstable or throttle.27
* DIY Customization: If a pre-made silicone cable is unavailable, one can be fabricated using silicone-jacketed RC wires (24AWG) and DIY USB connector shells. Braiding the wires (V+, GND, D+, D-) creates a flexible, durable loom.
6. Thermal Management Strategy
The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W packs a quad-core processor into a tiny package. Without management, core temperatures can easily exceed 70°C during encoding, triggering firmware throttling that stutters the video stream.3
6.1 Passive Cooling
* Heatsinks: A dedicated aluminum or copper heatsink is mandatory.28 The RP3A0 package is the primary heat generator. A 14mm x 14mm x 6mm finned heatsink increases the surface area significantly.
* Thermal Tape: High-quality thermal adhesive tape (often pre-applied to heatsinks) ensures efficient heat transfer from the SiP to the aluminum.
6.2 Convective Airflow
The mounting design must not hermetically seal the Pi.
* Open Frame Design: The preferred mounting method involves an open "skeleton" frame or simple clip mount rather than a fully enclosed box. This utilizes ambient air movement (convection) and the user's movement (forced air) to cool the fins.
* Orientation: Ideally, the heatsink fins should be oriented vertically (relative to the head's position) to aid natural convection, though this is a minor optimization compared to simply having the heatsink exposed to air.
7. Software Architecture and Streaming Pipeline
The hardware is only as good as the software driving it. The goal is a low-latency, synchronized A/V stream that initiates automatically on boot.
7.1 Operating System Configuration
OS Choice: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit). The "Lite" version lacks a desktop environment, saving RAM and CPU cycles. The 64-bit kernel is optimized for the Cortex-A53 cores of the Zero 2 W.11
Headless Setup:
1. Image Flashing: Use Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the OS to the microSD card.
2. Configuration: In the Imager settings, enable SSH, set the hostname (e.g., smartglasses), and configure Wi-Fi credentials (wpa_supplicant).30 This allows the Pi to connect to your home network or a mobile hotspot immediately upon first boot without a monitor/keyboard.
7.2 The Audio Driver Stack
To enable the I2S microphone, the Linux kernel must be instructed to load the appropriate driver overlay.
1. Overlay Configuration:
Edit /boot/firmware/config.txt (or /boot/config.txt on older OS versions):
Bash
# Enable I2S interface
dtparam=i2s=on
# Load the generic I2S driver compatible with INMP441
dtoverlay=googlevoicehat-soundcard

2. Verification:
After reboot, arecord -l should list the device. Note the card number (e.g., card 1).
3. ALSA Volume:
The MEMS mic might default to low gain. Use alsamixer to boost the capture volume to a usable level.31
7.3 Video Encoding Pipeline: libcamera vs. Legacy
The legacy raspivid stack is deprecated. We utilize libcamera (specifically rpicam-vid) which interfaces directly with the hardware ISP (Image Signal Processor) and encoder.32
Latency Optimization:
Latency is the enemy of live streaming. Standard HTTP streams can have 5-10 seconds of delay.
   * H.264 Hardware Encoding: The Zero 2 W's GPU handles this.
   * Inline Headers: The --inline flag must be used. This inserts SPS/PPS (Sequence Parameter Set / Picture Parameter Set) headers before every keyframe, allowing a viewer to join the stream instantly without waiting for the next IDR frame.
7.4 The Streaming Server: MediaMTX
MediaMTX (formerly rtsp-simple-server) is a zero-dependency, ultra-lightweight media broker perfect for the Pi Zero.33 It can ingest an RTSP stream and re-broadcast it as WebRTC (sub-second latency) or HLS (for recording).
Installation:
Download the binary for ARM64 architecture from the GitHub releases page. Extract it to /usr/local/bin/.
Configuration (mediamtx.yml):
We define a path that executes our encoding command on demand (when a user connects) or on init (always running). For a body cam, on init is preferred to ensure recording is always active.


YAML




paths:
 cam:
   # Command to run when the server starts
   runOnInit: >
     rpicam-vid -t 0 --inline -o - --width 1280 --height 720 --framerate 30 --bitrate 2000000 --nopreview | \
     ffmpeg -f h264 -i - \
     -f alsa -ac 1 -ar 44100 -i plughw:1,0 \
     -c:v copy \
     -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
     -f rtsp -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://localhost:8554/cam
   runOnInitRestart: yes

Pipeline Explanation:
   1. rpicam-vid: Captures video from Camera Module 3. Encodes to H.264 in hardware. Pipes raw H.264 to STDOUT.
   2. ffmpeg: Reads raw video from STDIN (-i -). Reads audio from ALSA device (plughw:1,0).
   3. Mixing: FFmpeg muxes the audio and video. Crucially, we use -c:v copy to pass the video stream without re-encoding, saving CPU. We encode audio to AAC (-c:a aac) which is light enough for the CPU.
   4. Output: Pushes the mixed stream back to MediaMTX via RTSP TCP loopback.35
7.5 Synchronization Challenges
Drift between audio and video timestamps is common in long recordings.37
   * Solution: Use FFmpeg's -use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1 option if drift occurs. This forces FFmpeg to timestamp frames based on their arrival time rather than the camera's internal clock.
8. Mechanical Fabrication and Ergonomics
Constructing the physical device without a 3D printer requires "macgyvering" skills using readily available office supplies and industrial adhesives.
8.1 The "Binder Clip" Chassis
The humble binder clip is a surprisingly effective mounting bracket.5
   * Mechanism: The metal loop of a medium binder clip can be removed, bent, and re-inserted to form a clamp. The plastic body of the Pi Zero case (or the bare board with spacers) can be bolted or glued to the flat steel face of the clip.
   * Mounting: The clip then attaches to the temple arm of a pair of glasses. The spring tension holds it secure.
8.2 Adhesive Mounting (The Permanent Solution)
For a sleeker profile:
   1. 3M VHB Tape: Use 3M VHB (Very High Bond) double-sided tape. This is the same tape used to attach GoPro mounts to helmets. It dampens vibration and provides a near-permanent bond.20
   2. Placement: Mount the Camera Module 3 directly to the frame temple, near the hinge. Mount the Pi Zero 2 W further back, behind the ear if possible, or on the strap.
   3. Cable Management: Use small zip ties or "heat shrink" tubing. Slide heat shrink over the temple arm and the cables, then shrink it down. This secures the cables tightly to the glasses, creating a professional "integrated" look and preventing snags.39
8.3 Weight Distribution
Balancing the HMU is critical.
   * Side-Heavy: If the Pi is mounted on the right temple, the glasses will tilt right.
   * Counterweight: The "Strap Mount" method helps here. Mounting the Pi on the back of a head strap puts the weight on the back of the neck/head, balancing the camera weight on the nose.40
9. Testing, Calibration, and Optimization
Once assembled, the system requires tuning.
9.1 Network Optimization
   * Wi-Fi Band: The Zero 2 W supports 2.4GHz only. This band is crowded. Ensure the channel width is set to 20MHz for stability rather than speed.
   * Bitrate: Start at 2Mbps (--bitrate 2000000). If artifacts appear, lower to 1.5Mbps. 1080p typically requires 4-6Mbps for high quality, but for streaming/recording on a Zero, 720p at 2-3Mbps is the reliability sweet spot.2
9.2 Thermal Benchmarking
Run the system for 30 minutes and monitor vcgencmd measure_temp.
   * < 60°C: Excellent.
   * 60°C - 75°C: Acceptable.
   * > 80°C: Critical. Throttling will occur. Improve airflow or check heatsink contact.
9.3 Audio Gain Staging
Record silence. If there is a hiss, the gain is too high. Record speech. If it clips (distorts), gain is too high. Adjust using alsamixer until the meter peaks around 80% during normal speech.
10. Conclusion
This report demonstrates that a high-fidelity, continuous-recording smart glass system is achievable within a ~$100 budget by adopting a tethered architecture and leveraging the specific hardware acceleration capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. By rejecting the constraints of fully integrated commercial designs—which sacrifice battery life and thermal performance for aesthetics—the builder achieves a device with superior runtime (>8 hours), professional-grade autofocus optics (IMX708), and a fully open, programmable software stack.
While the fabrication requires manual dexterity and the software configuration demands a familiarity with Linux subsystems, the result is a powerful tool for life-logging, security, or augmented reality research. It represents a triumph of function over form, proving that professional wearable utility is accessible through clever systems engineering and the strategic use of commodity hardware.
Use Case Implications
The resulting device is ideally suited for:
   * Journalism/Documentation: Hands-free recording of events.
   * Technical Assistance: Streaming a technician's viewpoint to a remote expert via WebRTC.
   * Security: A continuously running body-worn camera with off-site streaming (evidence preservation).
The open nature of the platform ensures that as software improves (e.g., AI object detection models tailored for the Zero 2 W), the hardware's utility will continue to expand, offering a longevity unmatched by closed consumer ecosystems.

And what if I upped it to $200, $500, $1000?
Currently, what is the most restricted thing that's hamperingy getup at $100?
Could I use this to stream to TikTok?
This is a complex engineering challenge, but it is achievable. I have broken this down into a realistic build plan, price tiers, and the specific software/hardware "hacks" needed for TikTok.
The "Corded" Approach (Highly Recommended)
Since you are open to a corded setup, do this. It solves the three biggest problems of DIY smart glasses: Heat, Weight, and Battery Life.
Instead of putting the computer on your face, you build a "Compute Puck" (about the size of a phone) that sits in your pocket. A thin cable runs up to your glasses frames.
   * On your face: Only the camera module, microphone, and a small display (optional). Extremely light.
   * In your pocket: The battery (20,000mAh) and the computer (Raspberry Pi 4 or 5).
________________


Tier 1: The $100 "MVP" Build
Goal: A working wearable camera that streams video. The "Restricted" Reality: At $100, you cannot afford a transparent "Tony Stark" display. You are building a POV streaming rig.
The Parts List:
   * Computer: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W ($15) — Tiny, but capable of 720p streaming.
   *    * Camera: Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 or a generic "Spy Camera" ribbon cable version ($25).
   * Battery: Standard USB Power Bank ($20) — Keep this in your pocket.
   * Cable: Long flexible ribbon cable for the camera ($10) — Runs from pocket to glasses.
   * Audio: USB Lavalier Microphone ($10) — Clip to collar, plug into Pi.
   * Frames: Thrift store sunglasses or 3D printed mount ($5-$10).
Capabilities:
   * Recording: 1080p to SD card (Easy).
   * Streaming: 720p at 30fps over Wi-Fi (Doable).
   * Battery Life: 5+ hours (because the battery is in your pocket).
The $100 Bottlenecks:
   1. No Visual Feedback: You can't see your chat or camera view. You are "flying blind."
   2. Overheating: The Pi Zero 2 W gets hot when encoding video. It needs a heatsink, or it will throttle (slow down) and your stream will lag.
   3. Setup: You must use a "headless" setup (SSH into the device from your phone) to start the stream.
________________


Tier 2: The $200 - $300 "Functioning Prototype"
Goal: Adding a display and better processing.
   * Upgrade Computer: Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (4GB RAM) in the pocket puck. ($60-$80)
   * Why: Handles 1080p vertical encoding effortlessly. Supports better Wi-Fi antennas for stable streaming.
   * Add Display: Vufine+ or a generic "Monocular Display" from AliExpress. ($100-$150)
   * Why: This clips onto your glasses and gives you a tiny screen. You can use this to see your TikTok chat or camera framing.
   * Better Camera: Arducam Autofocus Camera ($40).
   * Why: Fixed focus cameras are blurry if you look at something close up (like holding a product). Autofocus is crucial for quality.
________________


Tier 3: The $500 - $1,000 "Prosumer" Level
Goal: High-end optics and AI capabilities.
   * Optics: XREAL Air 2 or similar AR glasses ($300-$400).
   * Hack: You aren't building the display; you are buying a high-quality one and plugging your custom "Compute Puck" into it.
   * Compute: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano ($300+).
   * Why: This allows you to run AI on the glasses. You could write a script to "auto-zoom" on faces or read text out loud.
   * Connectivity: Portable 4G/5G LTE Modem HAT ($50-$100).
   * Why: No need to tether to your phone's hotspot. The glasses have their own internet.

Streaming to TikTok (The Hard Part)
Can you stream to TikTok? Yes, but TikTok makes it annoying. They use RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol), but they don't give "Stream Keys" to everyone.
The Requirements:
   1. 1,000 Followers: Generally, you need 1k+ followers to unlock "Go Live."
   2. Stream Key Access: You need to get the RTMP URL and Key from the TikTok desktop site ("TikTok Live Studio" or "Cast to PC" option).
   1. The Software "Hack" (For the $100 Pi Setup): You don't need OBS on the Pi (it's too heavy). You use a tool called FFmpeg.
The Command: You would run a script on the Raspberry Pi that looks like this:
Bash
libcamera-vid -t 0 --inline -o - | ffmpeg -re -i - -f lavfi -i anullsrc -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -vf "transpose=1" -f flv rtmp://[TIKTOK_URL]/[STREAM_KEY]


   * transpose=1: Rotates the video 90 degrees (Vertical Video) so it looks correct on TikTok.
   * libx264: The encoding format.
   * rtmp://...: This sends the video directly to TikTok's servers.
   * Summary of Restrictions
