### Attention-Based Measurement (New Standard)

#### **The Shift from Impressions to Attention:**

**Problem with Current Metrics:**
- Impressions ≠ attention
- Views can be passive/accidental
- Doesn't measure actual engagement with content

**IAB Standards (2025):**
- Interactive Advertising Bureau rolling out **attention measurement standards**
- Attention is **better predictor of business results** than raw impressions
- Measures actual viewing time, interaction, and retention

#### **What Attention Metrics Measure:**
- **Viewability:** Was content actually visible on screen?
- **Time in View:** How long was it viewed?
- **Interaction Depth:** Scrolling, pausing, rewatching
- **Audio Status:** Was sound on or muted?
- **Completion Rate:** Percentage of video/content consumed

#### **Implementation for B2B:**
- Focus on **watch time** over views
- Track **completion rates** for videos
- Measure **scroll depth** on carousels
- Monitor **repeat viewership**
- Prioritize content that holds attention, not just attracts clicks

**2025 Shift:**

- Provide value in others' spaces, not just own channels

**Why It Works:**

- Higher trust (organic discovery vs ads)
- Lower cost than paid acquisition
- Community validation and social proof

#### **Tactical Approaches:**

**1. Strategic Comment Engagement**
