## Cross-Selling Frameworks

### The 3-Tier Cross-Selling Model

Based on B2B service cross-selling research, the most effective framework for Print Junkie → Tricon is:

#### **Tier 1: Embedded Cross-Sell (60% of opportunities)**
**What:** Mention design services during natural print conversations
**When:** Order placement, consultation, follow-up
**Example CTAs:**
- "Need help with the design? We can handle simple layouts, or our sister company Tricon can create something custom."
- "We include basic design with every order. Want something more advanced? Check out @TriconDigital."

**Why it works:**
- 60-70% conversion rate when selling to existing customers
- Low friction (already in buying mode)
- Educational, not pushy

#### **Tier 2: Value-Based Upsell (30% of opportunities)**
**What:** Offer design as a complementary service that enhances print ROI
**When:** After customer sees initial print results
**Example CTAs:**
- "Your business cards look great! Want a matching website to drive traffic? Tricon specializes in that."
- "We noticed your flyers get great engagement. Want to automate your social posts with AI? Talk to Tricon."

**Why it works:**
- Timing matters: upsell AFTER delivering initial promises
- Focus on customer's specific needs (personalization = 89% ROI)
- Positions Tricon as a solution, not a sales pitch

#### **Tier 3: Strategic Partnership (10% of opportunities)**
**What:** Position Tricon as the "full-service marketing partner"

### The "Good-Better-Best" Design Tiering

**How to position design services without confusing customers:**

| Tier | Service | Provider | Price Point | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **GOOD** | Basic Design Included | Print Junkie | FREE (built into print cost) | Simple layouts, text adjustments, basic edits |
| **BETTER** | Custom Design Add-On | Print Junkie → Tricon Referral | $50-150/project | Logo design, branded templates, custom graphics |
| **BEST** | Full Marketing Partner | Tricon Digital | $500-2,000+/month | Websites, automation, AI tools, ongoing design |

**Key Insight:** Offering "Good" (free basic design) reduces friction and establishes trust. Once customers see quality, they're **14X more likely** to upgrade to "Better" or "Best."

---

### The Trust-Then-Upsell Timeline

**Critical Timing Research:**
- **DO NOT** cross-sell immediately (feels pushy)
- **DO** cross-sell after delivering initial value (builds trust)
- **DO** cross-sell when customer expresses a need (problem-solution fit)

**Recommended Timeline:**

| Customer Touchpoint | Print Junkie Action | Tricon Cross-Sell Opportunity |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **First Order** | Deliver excellent print + basic design | None (build trust first) |
| **Order Delivered** | Follow-up: "How'd it turn out?" | None (gauge satisfaction) |
| **2-3 Weeks Post-Order** | Share case study or portfolio post | Soft mention: "Need more? Check out @TriconDigital" |
| **Second Order** | Mention design services casually | "Want a matching website/logo/automation?" |
| **3+ Orders** | Position as strategic partner | Full Tricon pitch: "Let's scale your business together" |

**Why this works:**
- First order = trust-building (no upsell pressure)
- 60-70% of second purchases come from existing customers
- Strategic partnership positioning after 3+ orders = long-term retention

---

## Sister Company Positioning Strategies

### Two Models: House of Brands vs Branded House

**House of Brands (RECOMMENDED for Print Junkie + Tricon):**
- Each brand has **separate identity, positioning, and messaging**
- Minimal visual overlap (different logos, colors, tone)
- Each brand targets **different primary needs** (print vs digital)
- Cross-promotion is **subtle and strategic** (not aggressive)

**Why House of Brands works for Print Junkie + Tricon:**
- Avoids cannibalization (print customers ≠ digital customers initially)
- Allows each brand to develop expertise reputation
- Customers don't feel "bait-and-switched" to sister brand
- Sub-brands competing improves productivity and creativity

**Branded House (NOT recommended):**
- One umbrella brand (e.g., "Tricon Print & Digital")
- Shared visual identity
- Risk: Customers confused about what you specialize in
- Dilutes brand authority in both spaces

---

### How to Communicate the Sister Company Relationship

**Key Principle:** Be transparent but don't over-explain.

#### **Messaging Framework:**

**Print Junkie's Positioning:**
> "We're Print Junkie AZ—your local print partner for business cards, banners, apparel, and more. Need complex design work? Our sister company Tricon Digital specializes in websites, automation, and AI tools."

**Tricon Digital's Positioning:**
> "We're Tricon Digital—AI-powered business solutions for solopreneurs and small businesses. Need print work? Our sister company Print Junkie AZ has you covered."

**Cross-Promotion Language (1-2X/month):**
- **Print Junkie Post:** "Behind every great print job is great design. For complex branding, websites, and automation, we trust @TriconDigital. 🤝"
- **Tricon Post:** "Digital marketing works best with great print materials. For business cards, banners, and merch, check out @PrintJunkieAZ. 🤝"

**What NOT to say:**
- ❌ "We're the same company" (confusing)
- ❌ "Transfer you to our design team" (feels like upsell trap)
- ❌ "We do everything" (dilutes expertise)

**What TO say:**
- ✅ "We partner with our sister company Tricon for that"
- ✅ "We focus on print. Tricon focuses on digital. Together, we've got you covered."
- ✅ "Same owner, different expertise. Best of both worlds."

---

### Avoiding Cannibalization: Clear Brand Distinctions

**Print Junkie's Lane:**
- Physical print products (cards, flyers, banners, apparel)
- Basic design services (layouts, simple edits)
- Product installs (window graphics, vehicle wraps)
- Local Phoenix-area focus

**Tricon Digital's Lane:**
- Websites and web applications
- AI tools and automation
- Complex graphic design (brand identity, illustrations)
- Social media strategy and management
- Broader geographic reach (remote-first)

**Overlap Zone (Handoff Trigger):**
- Customer needs logo design → Print Junkie refers to Tricon
- Customer needs business cards → Tricon refers to Print Junkie
- Customer wants "full marketing package" → Joint proposal

**Key Insight:** Research shows that **clear positioning prevents cannibalization** while **strategic overlap creates handoff opportunities**. Each brand should have a **unique value proposition** but acknowledge the sister brand as the expert for complementary needs.

---

## Service Positioning: Basic vs Premium Design

### The "Included vs. Premium" Model

**Challenge:** How to offer design without undermining Tricon or confusing customers?

**Solution:** Position Print Junkie design as "included basic" and Tricon as "premium custom."

#### **Print Junkie: Basic Design (Included)**

**What's Included:**
- Simple text layout for business cards
- Pre-designed templates for flyers/banners
- Basic photo edits (cropping, brightness, simple color correction)
- File format conversions (PDF, PNG, JPG)

**Positioning:**
- "Basic design included with every order"
- "We'll make sure your files print perfectly"
- "Simple layouts, fast turnarounds"

**Time Investment:** 15-30 minutes per project (sustainable for Print Junkie)

**Customer Perception:** "They help me get it print-ready" (utility, not premium design)

---

#### **Tricon Digital: Premium Design (Custom)**

**What's Included:**
- Custom logo design (3+ concepts, unlimited revisions)
- Brand identity packages (logo + colors + fonts + style guide)
- Complex graphics (illustrations, infographics, social templates)
- Website design and development
- Ongoing design retainers (subscription model)

**Positioning:**
- "Custom design that tells your brand story"
- "Stand out with professional branding"
- "AI-powered design + automation"

**Price Points:**
- Logo design: $150-500
- Brand identity package: $500-1,500
- Website design: $1,000-5,000
- Monthly retainer: $500-2,000/month

**Customer Perception:** "They're the experts for serious branding" (premium, strategic investment)

---

### The Handoff Script

**When a Print Junkie customer needs more than basic design:**

**Print Junkie says:**
> "We can definitely handle simple layouts for you, but if you want something custom that really stands out, our sister company Tricon Digital specializes in that. They do amazing logo design, branding, and websites. Want me to connect you?"

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges Print Junkie's limitation (builds trust)
- Positions Tricon as the expert (elevates perceived value)
- Asks permission (not pushy)
- Seamless handoff (sister company = trusted referral)

**Follow-Up:**
- Print Junkie sends intro email connecting customer + Tricon
- Tricon offers "Print Junkie referral discount" (10-15% off first project)
- Print Junkie gets referral credit (future revenue share or reciprocal referrals)

---

### Pricing Psychology: Free Basic Design

**Research Insight:** Offering free basic design reduces friction and increases order volume.

**Example from Print Junkie's Business:**
- **Business Cards:** $75/1,000 (cost $25, profit $50 = 66% margin)
- **Add 15 minutes basic design:** Still profitable at $50 margin
- **Customer perception:** "Wow, design included!" (adds value without reducing profit)

**Upsell Trigger:**
> "We included a simple layout for you. If you want a custom logo or brand refresh, Tricon can help with that. Here's their portfolio: [link]"

**Conversion Math:**
- 100 Print Junkie customers
- 60-70 see basic design included (trust built)
- 10-20 need premium design (referral to Tricon)
- 5-10 convert to Tricon customers (60-70% existing customer conversion rate)
- 5 customers × $500 avg Tricon project = **$2,500 additional revenue**

**Key Insight:** Free basic design is a **loss leader** that drives **premium design upsells** to Tricon.

---

## Bundling Strategies

### Three Bundling Models for Print + Design

Based on product bundling research, here are the most effective models for Print Junkie + Tricon cross-selling:

---

#### **1. Pure Bundle (Package Only)**

**What:** Print + Design services sold as a single package (not available separately)

**Example Packages:**

| Package Name | Includes | Price | Savings |
|--------------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Startup Kit** | 1,000 business cards + Logo design + Basic website | $1,200 | 15% off |
| **Event Pack** | Flyers (500) + Banners (2) + Social graphics (5) | $400 | 10% off |
| **Rebrand Bundle** | Logo + Brand guide + Business cards + Letterhead | $1,500 | 20% off |

**Positioning:**
- "Everything you need to launch/rebrand/promote"
- "One price, complete solution"
- Sold jointly by Print Junkie + Tricon (shared revenue)

**Pros:**
- Higher average order value (AOV)
- Simplifies decision-making for customers
- Forces bundled purchase (maximizes cross-sell)

**Cons:**
- Less flexibility for customers who only need one service
- Requires tight coordination between Print Junkie + Tricon

**Best For:** New businesses, rebrands, event launches

---

#### **2. Mixed Bundle (Package OR Individual)**

**What:** Customers can buy the bundle at a discount OR purchase items separately

**Example:**

| Option | Price | Savings |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Business Card Design** (Tricon only) | $150 | - |
| **1,000 Business Cards** (Print Junkie only) | $75 | - |
| **Design + Print Bundle** | $200 | $25 (11%) |

**Positioning:**
- "Get both for less"
- "Save when you bundle"
- Customers choose what they need

**Pros:**
- Flexibility for customers
- Upsell opportunity ("Save $25 by bundling")
- Works for one-off purchases or recurring clients

**Cons:**
- Some customers will skip the bundle (lower cross-sell rate)
- Requires separate pricing for each service

**Best For:** Repeat customers, budget-conscious clients, flexible needs

---

#### **3. Cross-Sell Bundle (Complementary Services)**

**What:** Combine Print Junkie + Tricon services that naturally go together

**Example Bundles:**

| Bundle | Print Junkie Service | Tricon Service | Total Price | Savings |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Social Media Launch** | Business cards (1,000) | 10 social graphics + bio setup | $250 | 10% |
| **Website + Print** | Business cards + Flyers | Website design | $1,500 | 15% |
| **Full Rebrand** | Cards + Banners + Apparel | Logo + Brand guide + Website | $3,000 | 20% |

**Positioning:**
- "Your print materials should match your online brand"
- "Consistent branding across all touchpoints"
- "We've done the hard work—these services pair perfectly"

**Pros:**
- Natural pairing (reduces customer decision fatigue)
- Demonstrates value of integrated services
- Higher perceived value (complete solution)

**Cons:**
- Requires educating customers on why services complement each other
- Coordination between Print Junkie + Tricon timelines

**Best For:** Customers launching new brands, rebranding, or scaling their business

---

### Bundling Pricing Strategy

**Research-Backed Discount Rates:**

> "For businesses where average margins are 50% or less, a discount rate between **5-10%** typically will suffice."

**Print Junkie Math:**
- Business cards: 66% margin ($50 profit on $75 sale)
- Can afford 10-15% discount on bundles

**Tricon Math:**
- Logo design: ~70% margin ($350 profit on $500 sale)
- Can afford 15-20% discount on bundles

**Recommended Bundle Discounts:**

| Bundle Size | Discount | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Small** (Print + Basic Design) | 5-10% | Entry-level, encourages trial |
| **Medium** (Print + Logo/Branding) | 10-15% | Mid-tier, balances savings + profit |
| **Large** (Print + Website/Full Rebrand) | 15-20% | High-value, justifies larger discount |

**Key Insight:** Bundle discounts should be **visible and clear** ("Save $50!") but not so steep that they erode profit margins.

---

### Product + Service Bundles

**Research Finding:** Combining physical products (print) with services (design, installation, support) increases perceived value.

**Print Junkie + Tricon Example:**

**"Business Launch Bundle" - $1,200 (Save $200)**

**Print Junkie Provides:**
- 1,000 business cards ($75)
- 500 flyers ($100)
- 1 banner ($50)
- Window install service ($100)

**Tricon Digital Provides:**
- Logo design ($500)
- Basic website (5 pages) ($800)
- Social media bio setup ($75)

**Total Value:** $1,700
**Bundle Price:** $1,200
**Savings:** $200 (12% discount)

**Positioning:**
> "Everything you need to launch your business—print materials, branding, and online presence. One package, one price."

**Why it works:**
- Combines tangible (print) + intangible (design) for complete solution
- 12% discount is attractive but maintains profit
- Removes decision paralysis ("What do I need first?")

---

## CTA Best Practices

### The Anatomy of a High-Converting CTA

**Research-Backed Principles:**

1. **Crystal Clear:** Size, wording, and color impact clickthrough rates
2. **Action-Oriented:** Use verbs that inspire immediate action
3. **Benefit-Focused:** Tell customers what they GET, not what they DO
4. **Visible:** Make it easy to see and understand

---

### CTA Hierarchy for Sister Company Referrals

#### **Tier 1: Soft CTAs (Primary use)**

**When to use:** Portfolio posts, educational content, Stories

**Examples:**
- "Need design help? DM us." *(Keeps conversation in Print Junkie's DMs, then hand off)*
- "Design by @TriconDigital" *(Tag mention, low pressure)*
- "Check out @TriconDigital for websites and branding" *(Informational, not salesy)*

**Why it works:**
- Low friction (just a mention, not a hard sell)
- Maintains Print Junkie's focus (not overshadowed by Tricon)
- Curiosity-driven (customers click @mention if interested)

---

#### **Tier 2: Medium CTAs (Monthly use)**

**When to use:** Cross-promotion posts, bundle offers, email campaigns

**Examples:**
- "Save 15% with our Print + Design bundle. DM 'BUNDLE' to learn more." *(Clear savings, action verb)*
- "Want a website to match your new cards? Tricon can help. Get 10% off: [link]" *(Benefit-focused)*
- "Follow @TriconDigital for business tips and AI hacks" *(Value proposition)*

**Why it works:**
- Action-oriented ("DM," "Get," "Follow")
- Benefit clear (savings, tips, hacks)
- Not pushy (still informational tone)

---

#### **Tier 3: Hard CTAs (Quarterly use)**

**When to use:** Major promotions, launches, special events

**Examples:**
- "LIMITED TIME: Book print + design this week, save $100. Claim your spot: [link]" *(Urgency + scarcity)*
- "Get This Deal: Full rebrand (logo + cards + website) for $1,200. Only 5 spots left." *(Dollar amount + scarcity)*
- "Ready to scale? Print Junkie + Tricon = your complete marketing team. Book a free consult: [link]" *(Strategic positioning)*

**Why it works:**
- Urgency ("Limited time," "Only 5 spots")
- Clear value ("Save $100," "$1,200")
- Strong action verb ("Claim," "Book," "Get")

**Warning:** Hard CTAs should be **rare** (quarterly max). Overuse creates sales fatigue.

---

### A/B Testing CTAs

**Test these variables:**

| Variable | Option A | Option B | Hypothesis |

### Expected Outcomes (6 Months)

2. **Trust before upsell:** Deliver excellent print first, then offer Tricon
3. **Clear brand distinctions:** Print Junkie ≠ Tricon (avoid cannibalization)
4. **Visible savings:** Bundles must show dollar amount ("Save $25") not just percentage
5. **Data-driven:** Track referrals, conversion rates, adjust based on results

---

### Research Gaps & Future Work

**What we know well:**
- Cross-selling frameworks (14X higher conversion to existing customers)
- Multi-brand positioning (House of Brands vs Branded House)
- Bundling strategies (5-10% discount for 50% margin businesses)
- CTA best practices (action-oriented, benefit-focused)

**What needs more research:**
- **Print-specific design positioning** (limited case studies on "basic vs premium" design in print shops)
- **Sister company case studies** (most research is on multi-brand conglomerates, not small business sister companies)
- **Local cross-promotion tactics** (Print Junkie is Phoenix-focused, most research is national/global)

**Future research topics:**
1. Local SEO for sister companies (how to rank for "print shop Phoenix" AND "web design Phoenix")
2. Print + digital attribution (how to track which Print Junkie customers came from Tricon content)
3. Long-term retention strategies (how to keep customers using both brands for years)
