**April 2025 Algorithm Update**: Facebook rolled out significant changes to combat spammy posts, misleading engagement tactics, and low-quality comments. This update heavily impacts financial services content.

**AI-Driven Recommendations**: The 2025 algorithm focuses on:
- AI-driven content recommendations
- Deeper engagement metrics (conversations over passive likes)
- Meaningful interactions between users
- Group-based discussions over business page posts

### What Gets Prioritized

1. **Conversations over passive engagement**: Long-form comments and discussions carry more weight than likes and reactions
2. **Consistent posting**: Users who post consistently receive 5x more engagement per post
3. **Group-based content**: Posts within highly engaged groups have increased visibility compared to standard page content
4. **Meaningful interactions**: Content that sparks genuine conversations between users

### What Gets Downranked

- Low-quality health or financial claims (miracle cures, get-rich-quick schemes)
- Exaggerated health claims or cosmetic procedure promotions
- Misleading business models (payday loans, "risk-free" investments)
- Engagement bait tactics
- Contest-heavy content

### Critical Impact on Financial Services

- **Organic reach limited to 5.5%** for business pages
- Businesses may experience reduced reach for certain content types
- Sensitive financial content actively scrutinized

## 13. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Content Pitfalls

❌ **Over-promoting rates without context**: Focus on value and education, not just lowest rate claims
❌ **Ignoring compliance requirements**: Can result in regulatory fines and reputational damage
❌ **Posting inconsistently**: Algorithm penalizes sporadic posting
❌ **Text-heavy posts**: Visual content performs 65% better
❌ **Generic stock photos**: Authentic images drive 3x more engagement
❌ **Engagement bait**: "Share if you agree" tactics are downranked by algorithm
❌ **Too many hashtags**: Facebook isn't Instagram; use 1-2 max
❌ **Ignoring comments**: Engagement signals to algorithm; respond within 1 hour when possible
❌ **One-way broadcasting**: Social media is conversational, not a megaphone

### Strategic Pitfalls

❌ **No content calendar**: Leads to inconsistent, reactive posting
❌ **Focusing only on reach**: Engagement and conversions matter more than vanity metrics
❌ **Neglecting video content**: Video generates 59% more engagement
❌ **Not testing different formats**: What works for others may not work for your audience
❌ **Ignoring Facebook Groups**: Community engagement is increasingly important
❌ **Set-and-forget approach**: Social media requires active management and optimization
❌ **No clear CTA**: Every post should have a purpose and next step
❌ **Targeting too broadly**: Use available targeting wisely despite restrictions

### Compliance Pitfalls

❌ **Making guarantee claims**: "Guaranteed approval" violates regulations
❌ **Advertising rates without disclosures**: Must include APR, disclaimers
❌ **Not archiving communications**: Legal requirement for financial institutions
❌ **Discriminatory language or imagery**: Violates Fair Housing Act
❌ **Exaggerated savings claims**: Must be substantiated and include disclaimers
❌ **Missing NMLS number**: Required on all business communications
❌ **Not monitoring employee posts**: Loan officers need supervision and training
