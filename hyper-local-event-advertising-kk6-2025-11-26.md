# HYPER-LOCAL EVENT ADVERTISING RESEARCH REPORT
**KannaKickback 6 - December 6, 2025**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Direct cannabis/420 event advertising is **PROHIBITED** on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. You cannot advertise this event as "420-friendly" without risking immediate ad rejection or account ban.

**RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:** Position KannaKickback 6 as a **"21+ Holiday Charity Event & Toy Drive"** focusing on community, charity, and festive celebration. Avoid all cannabis references in ads.

---

## PLATFORM RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ RECOMMENDED: Facebook & Instagram (Meta)
**Why:** Best hyper-local targeting, proven event promotion tools, manageable compliance if you avoid cannabis terms.

### ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED: TikTok
**Why:**
- Stricter cannabis policies (even CBD content gets flagged)
- Requires larger budgets for effective reach
- Hashtags like #420, #cannabis trigger automated bans
- 10-day timeline too short for TikTok algorithm to optimize

**VERDICT:** Focus 100% of budget on Facebook/Instagram.

---

## COMPLIANCE & RISK MITIGATION

### Cannabis Advertising Policies (2025)

**What's Prohibited:**
- Direct promotion of THC/cannabis products (Meta policy)
- Terms: "420," "cannabis," "weed," "THC," "marijuana," "bud," "pot" (flagged keywords)
- Event tickets/pricing for cannabis-related events
- Images showing cannabis consumption

**What's Allowed:**
- 21+ community events (treated like alcohol promotions)
- Charity/toy drive focus
- Holiday party messaging
- Location-based targeting for adults 21+

### AD COPY COMPLIANCE STRATEGY

**SAFE MESSAGING:**
```
❌ DON'T SAY: "420-friendly holiday party"
✅ DO SAY: "21+ Holiday Celebration & Toy Drive"

❌ DON'T SAY: "KannaKrew cannabis community event"
✅ DO SAY: "KannaKrew's annual charity holiday party"

❌ DON'T SAY: "Smoker's party benefiting Sojourner Center"
✅ DO SAY: "Community celebration supporting Sojourner Center"
```

**VISUALS:**
- Use KannaKlaus, holiday themes, toy drive imagery
- NO cannabis leaves, smoking references, or 420 symbols in ads
- Focus on charity angle, festive vibe, community gathering

---

## TARGETING SETUP (FACEBOOK/INSTAGRAM)

### Geographic Targeting

**Method 1: Zip Code Targeting** (Facebook allows up to 50,000 zip codes)

Target these East Valley zip codes:
- **Gold Canyon (venue):** 85118
- **Apache Junction:** 85117, 85119, 85120
- **Queen Creek:** 85140, 85142, 85143
- **Santan Valley:** 85140, 85143

**Method 2: Drop Pin + Radius** (RECOMMENDED for local events)

1. Drop pin at: **Ginza Asian Fusion, Gold Canyon, AZ**
2. Set radius: **15-20 miles** (covers Apache Junction, Queen Creek, Santan Valley)
3. Select: **"People living in this location"** (targets locals, not tourists)

**Why radius targeting:** More effective than multiple zip codes for event footfall

### Age & Demographic Targeting

- **Age:** 21-65+ (Required for age-restricted events)
- **Gender:** All genders (to comply with Meta's non-discrimination policies)
- **Interests (Optional):** Community events, charity, holiday celebrations, local restaurants

**AVOID:** Cannabis-related interests (will trigger compliance review)

---

## AD FORMAT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommended Format: 4:5 Vertical Video (15-30 seconds)

**Why:**
- 4:5 vertical video consistently outperforms square/horizontal
- 15-30 second videos drive highest engagement for events
- Works across Feed + Stories + Reels placements
- Video creates urgency better than static images

**Video Specs:**
- **Resolution:** 1080 x 1350 pixels (4:5 ratio)
- **Length:** 15-30 seconds
- **File size:** Under 4GB
- **Format:** MP4 or MOV

**Content Ideas:**
- KannaKlaus character reveal + event details
- Toy drive impact montage (past years' donations)
- Venue/food showcase from Ginza
- Countdown timer to December 6

### Alternative Format: Carousel Ads (3-5 cards)

**Why:**
- Great for storytelling multi-faceted events
- Show: Charity impact → Event details → Venue/food → RSVP CTA
- Lower cost-per-click than single images

**Each Card:**
- **Image:** 1080 x 1080 pixels (square)
- **Headline:** 40 characters max
- **Description:** 20 words max
- **CTA button:** "Learn More" or "RSVP"

---

## COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Before launching ads, verify:

- [ ] NO cannabis/420 terms in ad copy
- [ ] NO cannabis imagery in visuals
- [ ] Age targeting set to 21+ minimum
- [ ] Event positioned as "21+ charity celebration" not "smoker's party"
- [ ] CTA links to RSVP form (not ticket sales)
- [ ] Business Manager account has valid payment method
- [ ] Ad account is verified (if required)
- [ ] Website RSVP form has 21+ age gate (recommended)

**If Ad Gets Rejected:**
- Request review via Ads Manager
- Remove any flagged terms/images
- Emphasize charity + community angle
- Resubmit with cleaner copy

---

## PERFORMANCE MONITORING

### Key Metrics to Track Daily

**Awareness Metrics:**
- **Impressions:** How many people saw the ad
- **Reach:** Unique users who saw the ad
- **Frequency:** Average times each person saw it (keep under 3)

**Engagement Metrics:**
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** 1-2% is good for local events
- **Link Clicks:** Direct measure of interest
- **Cost Per Click (CPC):** Target under $0.50

**Conversion Metrics:**
- **RSVP Form Submissions:** Track via website analytics
- **Cost Per RSVP:** Divide total spend by RSVPs (target under $5)

### When to Adjust

**If CTR < 0.5%:** Creative isn't resonating
- Test new video/images
- Revise ad copy for more urgency

**If CPC > $1.00:** Audience too broad or competitive
- Narrow radius to 10 miles
- Refine age range (21-45)

**If Frequency > 3:** Audience fatigue
- Refresh creative
- Expand radius slightly

---

## ADVANCED TACTICS (OPTIONAL)

### Retargeting Strategy

**After Phase 1 (Nov 29):**
1. Create **Custom Audience** in Ads Manager:
   - Website visitors (last 7 days)
   - Video viewers (watched 50%+)
   - Engaged with ads (likes, comments, shares)

2. Create **Lookalike Audience**:
   - 1% lookalike of website visitors
   - Location: 20-mile radius from Ginza

3. Phase 2/3 ads: Target custom + lookalike audiences
   - Retargeting converts 3-5x better than cold traffic

### A/B Testing (If Budget Allows)

**Test Variables:**
- Video vs Carousel format
- Different CTAs ("RSVP" vs "Learn More")
- Charity-focused copy vs party-focused copy
- Age ranges (21-35 vs 35-55)

**How:**
- Duplicate ad set
- Change ONE variable
- Run both for 2 days
- Keep winner, pause loser

### Facebook Event Integration

**Consider creating Facebook Event:**
- More native RSVP experience
- Event attendees auto-create warm audience
- Free organic reach when people click "Interested"
- BUT: Less control over messaging

**If using Facebook Event:**
- Change campaign objective to "Event Responses"
- CTA button becomes "Interested" / "Going"
- May lower CPC vs website traffic

---

## RISK MITIGATION & BACKUP PLANS

### If Ads Get Rejected for Cannabis Association

**Plan B: Hyper-Conservative Messaging**
- Remove "KannaKrew" branding from ads (use generic "Community Holiday Party")
- Lead with charity only: "Toy Drive Celebration Benefiting Sojourner Center"
- Bury event organizer details in fine print
- Use completely generic holiday imagery (no KannaKlaus character)

### If Budget Doesn't Perform

**Free Alternatives:**
- Post in local Facebook Groups (Apache Junction community groups, Queen Creek moms groups, East Valley events)
- Share to personal profiles (ask KannaKrew members to share)
- Cross-promote with Ginza's social media
- Email blast to past attendees (if you have list)
- Post in local subreddits (r/apachejunction, r/queencreek)

### If Meta Account Gets Restricted

**Prevention:**
- Use business account, not personal
- Keep ID verification documents ready
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Link valid payment method

**If restricted:**
- Request review immediately
- Provide ID verification if requested
- Explain event is legal 21+ charity function
- May take 24-48 hours for review

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**LAUNCH TODAY** with this strategy:

1. **Focus 100% on Facebook/Instagram** (not TikTok)
2. **Position as "21+ Holiday Charity Event"** (avoid all 420/cannabis terms)
3. **Use 15-mile radius targeting** from Ginza venue
4. **Budget $97 over 10 days** ($5 → $8 → $15 daily ramp)
5. **Prioritize 4:5 vertical video** or carousel format
6. **Emphasize charity impact** (Sojourner Center donations)
7. **Create urgency in final 3 days** (Dec 4-6)

**Expected Outcome:** 20-40 RSVPs from paid ads, plus organic reach from shares/engagement.

**Risk Level:** MODERATE - Cannabis association could trigger ad rejections, but charity framing mitigates this.
