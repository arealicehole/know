## 1. X Algorithm Updates and For You Feed Mechanics (2024-2025)

### How the Algorithm Works

The X algorithm processes approximately **5 billion feed generations per day**, taking an average of **1.5 seconds** per personalized feed. The system:

1. **Candidate Selection**: Pulls ~1,500 tweets from accounts you follow + accounts you might be interested in
2. **Scoring**: Ranks content based on predicted engagement likelihood
3. **Filtering**: Removes duplicate/low-quality content
4. **Delivery**: Serves to your "For You" feed

### Major Algorithm Changes in 2024-2025

#### 1. **Emphasis on Smaller Accounts**
The algorithm now provides more visibility to smaller creators, reducing the dominance of mega-accounts. This is a deliberate strategy to diversify content and encourage new voices.

#### 2. **Verified Account Priority**
Premium/verified accounts receive significant algorithmic boosts:
- **Premium+**: ~1,550+ impressions per post
- **Premium**: ~600 impressions per post
- **Basic/Free accounts**: <100 impressions per post

Premium subscribers get **10x more reach** than non-subscribers, according to Buffer's analysis of 18.8 million posts.

#### 3. **Native Video Prioritization**
X heavily favors native video content:
- Videos uploaded directly to X (not YouTube links)
- Under 2:20 minutes in length
- Generate **10x engagement** compared to text-only posts
- **8.3 billion daily video views** on the platform

**Source**: [Vidico Statistics](https://vidico.com/news/x-aka-twitter-statistics-and-trends/)

#### 4. **External Link Deprioritization**
Posts with external links receive lower algorithmic distribution compared to native media or text-only content. If you must share links, use the first comment strategy (post content, then add link in a reply).

#### 5. **Engagement-Weighted Ranking**
The algorithm now weights engagement types differently:
- **Replies**: Highest weight (shows conversation value)
- **Quote Tweets**: High weight (adds new context/value)
- **Retweets**: Medium weight
- **Likes**: Lowest weight (passive signal)

### The Two Feed System

As of 2025, X maintains two distinct feeds:
- **"Following"**: Purely chronological, shows only accounts you follow
- **"For You"**: Algorithm-driven blend of followed accounts, recommendations, and trending content

Most users default to "For You," making algorithmic optimization essential.

## 2. Tweet and Thread Optimization for Engagement

### Single Tweet Best Practices

#### Optimal Tweet Length
- **Ideal**: 100-120 characters (increases engagement by 17%)
- **Maximum**: 280 characters (free), 25,000 characters (Premium)
- **Sweet spot**: Concise enough to scan, detailed enough to provide value

#### Posting Frequency
- **Recommended**: 1-5 high-quality tweets per day
- **Avoid**: Batch posting (10 tweets at once then silence)
- **Strategy**: Space posts evenly throughout the day

**Quality > Quantity**: "Better to post 2 quality tweets daily than 10 mediocre ones sporadically"

#### Best Posting Times (Global Average)
- **Peak engagement**: 9 AM, 12 PM, 1 AM
- **Morning slot**: 8-10 AM
- **Evening slot**: 6-9 PM

**Note**: Analyze your specific audience using X Analytics for personalized insights.

### Thread Strategy and Optimization

#### Why Threads Work

Threads are one of the highest-performing content formats on X in 2025:
- Generate **more impressions** than standalone tweets
- Increase **time spent on content by 60%**
- Drive deeper engagement and follower conversion

**However**: 94% of threads receive <10 retweets due to poor structure.

**Source**: [HipClip Thread Guide](https://www.hipclip.ai/workflows/how-to-create-x-twitter-threads-that-actually-go-viral-in-2025)

#### Optimal Thread Length
- **Sweet spot**: 5-10 tweets
- **Minimum**: 3-4 tweets (otherwise just post one tweet)
- **Maximum**: 15-20 tweets (diminishing attention beyond this)

#### Thread Structure Formula

**1. Hook Tweet (Tweet 1)**
- Must stop scrolling in 1 second
- Use proven patterns (see Hook section below)
- Set clear expectations for thread value

**2. Body Tweets (Tweets 2-9)**
- One clear idea per tweet
- Use visual breaks every 3-4 tweets (images, charts, screenshots)
- Strategic visual breaks increase completion rates by 45%
- Maintain pacing—avoid info dumps

**3. CTA Tweet (Final tweet)**
- Drive specific action (follow, reply, share, click)
- Example: "If this was helpful, retweet the first tweet to share with others"
- Include call to engage with your profile

#### Thread Content Frameworks

**Storytelling Framework** (best for case studies, personal experiences):
- Hook: Problem/situation
- Journey: How you solved it
- Results: Outcome + lessons
- CTA: Apply these insights

**Listicle Framework** (best for educational content):
- Hook: "7 ways to [achieve outcome]"
- 7 numbered tweets, each self-contained
- CTA: Bonus tip or next steps

**Contrarian Framework** (best for thought leadership):
- Hook: "Everyone says X. Here's why they're wrong."
- Dismantle conventional wisdom
- Present alternative view with evidence
- CTA: Engage with your take

## 3. Hook Writing Strategies for Maximum Impact

### The 1-Second Rule

Your hook has **1 second** to stop someone from scrolling. The first 1-2 lines determine whether 100 or 100,000 people read your content.

### Proven Hook Patterns

#### 1. **Curiosity Gap**
Leave information incomplete to compel the click.

Examples:
- "Nobody talks about this, but..."
- "Here's what no one tells you about..."
- "I made $50K in 30 days. Here's the playbook:"

#### 2. **Contrarian Statement**
Challenge conventional wisdom.

Examples:
- "Everyone says you need 10K followers to make money. That's false."
- "Unpopular opinion: Threads are better than single tweets"
- "Stop doing [popular thing]. Here's why:"

#### 3. **Specific Value Promise**
Tell readers exactly what they'll gain.

Examples:
- "7 copywriting formulas that tripled my engagement"
- "Here's how I gained 5,000 followers in 60 days (step-by-step)"
- "The exact email template that landed me 12 clients"

#### 4. **Bold Claim + Proof**
Make a strong assertion backed by evidence.

Examples:
- "I tested 500 tweet formats. These 5 performed best:"
- "After analyzing 10,000 viral tweets, I found a pattern:"
- "I grew from 0 to 100K followers. These are the only tactics that mattered:"

#### 5. **Question Hook**
Engage curiosity through questions.

Examples:
- "Want to 10x your engagement? Here's how:"
- "Wondering why your tweets get no views? I found the issue:"
- "Are you making these 7 Twitter mistakes?"

#### 6. **Storytelling Hook**
Start with a compelling narrative.

Examples:
- "6 months ago I had 200 followers. Today I have 50K. Here's what changed:"
- "I lost $10K on Twitter ads before learning this one thing:"
- "My first viral tweet happened by accident. Then I reverse-engineered it:"

### Hook Engineering: The 4-Part Formula

Top creators use this structure:

1. **Pattern Interrupt**: Bold/surprising statement
2. **Relevance**: Why it matters to the reader
3. **Credibility**: Why you're qualified to share this
4. **Promise**: What they'll gain by reading

**Example**:
"I analyzed 1M tweets (pattern interrupt). 99% fail because they ignore this one principle (relevance). After 3 years of testing (credibility), here's the framework that actually works (promise):"

---

## 4. Quote Tweets vs Retweets vs Replies Strategy

### Performance Data

According to academic research and platform analytics:
- **Quote Tweets**: Mean RT rate of 2.2, favorite rate of 2.6 (highest engagement)
- **Replies**: Medium engagement, high conversation value
- **Retweets**: Lowest engagement, but amplifies others

**Source**: [ACM Journal Study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3625680)

### Strategic Usage

#### Quote Tweets (QTs)
**When to use:**
- Adding your unique perspective to someone else's content
- Providing additional context or examples
- Disagreeing constructively with a take
- Amplifying content with your commentary

**Why they work:**
- Treated as **original content** by the algorithm
- Appears on your profile and in followers' feeds
- Shows thought leadership
- Creates conversation opportunities

**Best practice**: "Don't just retweet, add context" — always include your take

#### Retweets (RTs)
**When to use:**
- Pure amplification (no commentary needed)
- Supporting someone's announcement/launch
- Sharing content where your voice adds nothing
- Quick sharing during time constraints

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't appear as original content on your profile
- Lower algorithmic weight
- No opportunity to showcase your expertise

#### Replies
**When to use:**
- Direct conversation with the original poster
- Building relationships
- Adding value to ongoing discussions
- Answering questions

**Why they matter:**
- Highest algorithmic weight (shows genuine engagement)
- Builds community and relationships
- Increases visibility in conversations
- Creates dialogue opportunities

**Critical**: Respond to **every reply** on your tweets, especially in the first hour. This signals to the algorithm that your content sparks conversation.

### The 2025 Engagement Hierarchy

1. **Reply with value** (highest algorithmic weight + relationship building)
2. **Quote Tweet with insight** (treated as original content + amplification)
3. **Like** (lowest weight, passive signal)
4. **Retweet** (amplifies but adds no value)

**Strategic Mix**: Aim for 50% replies, 30% QTs, 20% RTs in your engagement activities.

## 5. Media (Images, Videos, GIFs) Performance

### Overall Media Impact

Posts with media get **2-3x higher engagement rates** compared to text-only posts. The algorithm actively prioritizes rich media content.

**Source**: [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/twitter-algorithm/)

### Performance by Media Type

#### Videos (Highest Performing)
- **10x engagement advantage** over text-only posts
- **8.3 billion daily video views** on X
- 80% of user sessions now include video watching
- Algorithm heavily favors native video

**Optimal specs (2025)**:
- **Resolution**: 1280 x 720 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Length**: Under 2:20 minutes (shorter = better for retention)
- **Upload**: Native to X (not YouTube links)
- **Captions**: Always include (80% watch without sound)

#### Images
- Increase retweets by **150%**
- Generate **50% more likes** and **34% more retweets**
- Recommended aspect ratio: **16:9** (e.g., 1200 x 675 px)
- Avoid cropping issues by sticking to platform specs

#### GIFs
- Strong engagement, especially for humor/reactions
- Ideal for commentary and relatable content
- Lower production effort than video
- Performs well in replies

### Technical Specifications for 2025

| Media Type | Recommended Size | Aspect Ratio | Notes |
|------------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| Images | 1200 x 675 px | 16:9 | Prevents cropping in feed |
| Videos | 1280 x 720 px | 16:9 | Under 2:20 min for best results |
| Header Image | 1500 x 500 px | 3:1 | Profile banner |
| Profile Photo | 400 x 400 px | 1:1 | Displays as circle |

### Best Practices

1. **Prioritize video** for tutorials, storytelling, and educational content
2. **Use images** for data visualization, quotes, and infographics
3. **Use GIFs** for reactions, humor, and personality
4. **Always optimize** to platform specs to avoid quality loss
5. **Add alt text** for accessibility (also helps SEO)

## 6. Hashtag Strategy on X (Has This Changed?)

### The Big Change: Hashtags Are Less Critical in 2025

Yes, hashtag strategy has fundamentally shifted on X. The consensus from 2025 research: **Hashtags still matter, but not in the way they used to.**

### Current Effectiveness

#### Performance Data
- Tweets with hashtags generate **33% more retweets**
- **18% better message association**
- **8% increased brand awareness**
- **3% higher purchase intent**

However, the algorithm now prioritizes **engagement and viral potential** over simple hashtag usage.

**Source**: [Monetag Hashtag Guide](https://monetag.com/blog/twitter-hashtags/), [Top Hashtags 2025](https://top-hashtags.com/blog/x-twitter-hashtag-strategy-guide-2025-maximizing-reach-engagement/)

### 2025 Best Practices

#### 1. Use 1-2 Hashtags Maximum
X's own research shows tweets with **1-2 hashtags** get highest engagement. Adding more looks spammy and reduces readability.

**Old strategy (pre-2024)**: 3-5 hashtags
**New strategy (2025)**: 1-2 highly relevant hashtags

#### 2. Natural Placement Over Stacking
- **Better**: "Just launched our new #ProductivityApp for remote teams"
- **Worse**: "Check out our new app #productivity #SaaS #remotework #tech #startup"

Hashtags work best when integrated naturally into sentences rather than stacked at the end.

#### 3. Relevance Over Reach
- **High-value tags**: 10K highly targeted users
- **Low-value tags**: 1M random users

Choose hashtags based on community alignment, not just search volume.

#### 4. Community Connection Tags
Focus on hashtags that signal membership in specific groups:
- Industry tags: #SEO, #ContentMarketing, #WebDev
- Community tags: #BuildInPublic, #IndieHackers, #SaaS
- Event tags: #SXSW2025, #MarketingConf

### What Changed?

**2023 and earlier**: Hashtags were primary discovery mechanism
**2025**: Algorithm prioritizes:
1. Engagement patterns (who you interact with)
2. Content type (video > text)
3. Premium status (verified accounts)
4. Conversation value (replies > likes)

Hashtags now function as **supporting tactics** rather than core strategy.

### When Hashtags Still Matter

- **Live events**: Conference hashtags drive real-time discovery
- **Trending topics**: Joining viral conversations
- **Niche communities**: Connecting with specific groups
- **Brand campaigns**: Creating trackable movement

### Shadow-Banning Warning

If engagement suddenly drops after using a hashtag, it may be shadow-banned. Monitor tag performance and pivot quickly.

**Bottom Line**: Use 1-2 relevant hashtags naturally integrated into your content. Focus energy on engagement and content quality instead.

## 7. Community Building and Conversation Tactics

### The Fundamental Shift

X in 2025 is **conversation-first**, not broadcast-first. The algorithm rewards genuine dialogue over one-way content distribution.

### Core Principle

"X is unique because the value of content isn't baked into the initial tweet but in the conversations that happen as a result. You won't be able to 'set and forget' your posts like on other platforms."

**Source**: [Advanced X Community Tips](https://social-lady.com/advanced-tips-for-engaging-and-growing-your-x-community/)

### Community Building Strategies

#### 1. The 30-Minute Engagement Rule

Spend 30 minutes daily on active engagement:
- Check mentions and respond to everyone
- Explore 2-3 relevant topics
- Join conversations where you can add value
- Reply to posts in your niche

This builds reciprocal relationships and algorithmic favor.

#### 2. High-Value Engagement Actions

**Ranked by impact:**
1. **Thoughtful replies** (adds substance, sparks dialogue)
2. **Insightful Quote Tweets** (adds perspective)
3. **Retweets with context** (amplifies + adds value)
4. **Likes** (passive, low impact)

Move beyond likes. Engage with substance.

#### 3. Reply to Every Comment (First Hour Critical)

Responding to replies—especially in the **first 60 minutes**—signals to the algorithm that your content drives conversation. This increases distribution.

**Tactic**: Set aside time immediately after posting to engage with early commenters.

#### 4. Interactive Features

**Twitter Spaces** (Live Audio):
- Deep engagement format
- Builds intimate community connections
- Positions you as thought leader
- Great for Q&A, panels, discussions

**Twitter Chats** (Scheduled Text Conversations):
- Organize regular chats around relevant topics
- Use dedicated hashtag
- Builds community and authority
- Predictable engagement spike

**Polls**:
- Easy engagement trigger
- Provides audience insights
- Algorithm boost (counted as interaction)

**Source**: [Taggbox Engagement Strategies](https://taggbox.com/blog/increase-twitter-engagement/)

#### 5. Authentic Voice Over Corporate Speak

"X is all about being authentic—be yourself, engage with other X users, and share what truly matters."

Avoid:
- Generic corporate language
- Over-polished marketing copy
- Constant self-promotion

Embrace:
- Personal stories
- Honest opinions
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Vulnerability and humor

#### 6. The 80/20 Content Rule

- **80%**: Valuable content (educational, entertaining, inspiring)
- **20%**: Promotional content

Provide value first, sell second.

#### 7. Proactive Conversation Seeking

Don't wait for people to come to you. Actively:
- Search relevant keywords in your niche
- Reply to questions you can answer
- Join trending conversations with your expertise
- Support others' launches and wins

### Engagement Metrics That Matter

Forget vanity metrics. Focus on:
- **Reply rate**: Are people responding to your content?
- **Conversation threads**: Are discussions happening under your tweets?
- **DMs**: Are people reaching out directly?
- **Mentions**: Are people tagging you organically?

**Community > Followers**: 1,000 engaged community members > 100,000 passive followers.

## 8. X Premium/Verified Benefits for Reach

### The Harsh Reality: Premium Is Now Essential for Serious Reach

Data from Buffer's analysis of **18.8 million posts** reveals a stark divide between Premium and free accounts in 2025.

### Reach Comparison by Account Type

| Account Type | Average Impressions Per Post | Engagement Rate |
|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Premium+ | 1,550+ | Higher reply visibility |
| Premium | ~600 | Medium boost |
| Basic Premium | ~150 | Small lift |
| Free Accounts | <100 | Declining (median 0% by March 2025) |

**Key finding**: Premium accounts get approximately **10x more reach** than free accounts.

**Source**: [Buffer X Premium Review](https://buffer.com/resources/x-premium-review/)

### How Premium Boosts Reach

#### 1. Algorithmic Preference
Verified accounts get:
- **30-40% higher reply impressions** (internal Q1 2025 tests)
- Priority placement in replies and conversations
- Higher visibility in search results
- Preferential ranking in "For You" feeds

#### 2. Monetization Features
- **Ad revenue sharing**: Earn based on engagement from other Premium users
- **Super Follows**: Offer exclusive paid content (35% of active creators use this)
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring revenue from loyal community

#### 3. Feature Access
- Longer posts (25,000 characters vs 280)
- Longer videos (up to 3 hours vs 2:20)
- Edit tweets (undo send)
- Advanced analytics
- Bookmark folders
- NFT profile pictures (Premium+)

#### 4. Prioritized Support
Premium users receive customer support; free users typically don't.

### The Free Account Decline

**Critical data**: Regular free accounts declined from 0.15% engagement to **median 0% by March 2025**. This means at least half of free accounts received **no likes, replies, or reposts** on their posts.

This isn't a bug—it's a business model shift. X is incentivizing Premium subscriptions through algorithmic throttling of free accounts.

**Source**: [Social Media Today](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/report-shows-paying-for-x-twitter-premkum-has-significant-reach-benefits/801881/)

### Premium Tier Comparison (2025)

| Feature | Free | Basic (~$3/mo) | Premium (~$8/mo) | Premium+ (~$16/mo) |
|---------|------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Reach boost | None | Small | 10x | 15x+ |
| Video length | 2:20 | 2 hours | 3 hours | 3 hours |
| Post length | 280 chars | 4,000 chars | 25,000 chars | 25,000 chars |
| Edit tweets | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Verification checkmark | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Ad revenue share | No | No | Yes | Yes (higher %) |
| Analytics | Basic | Basic | Advanced | Advanced |

**Source**: [UseVisuals Premium Comparison](https://usevisuals.com/blog/x-premium-cost-comparison)

### Is Premium Worth It?

**For casual users**: Probably not necessary
**For creators/brands**: Increasingly essential for meaningful reach

**ROI considerations:**
- If reach matters to your business, $8-16/mo is minimal cost
- Ad revenue sharing can offset subscription cost
- Community building is nearly impossible without Premium in 2025

**Bottom line**: X has structurally advantaged Premium users. If serious about growth, Premium is now table stakes.

## 9. Analytics Metrics That Matter Most

### The Engagement Rate Formula

**Engagement Rate = (Engagements / Impressions) × 100**

This is the single most important metric on X in 2025.

### 2025 Benchmarks

- **Average across all industries**: 0.029% (as of 2024)
- **Updated 2025 average**: 1.57% (21.5% YoY increase)
- **Good performance**: 0.5%+
- **Excellent performance**: 2%+
- **Industry range**: 0.02% - 0.09% for most sectors

**Highest performing industry**: Sports teams (0.072%)
**Lowest performing industry**: Media (0.009%)

**Sources**: [Metricool Engagement Guide](https://metricool.com/twitter-engagement/), [Brand24 Metrics](https://brand24.com/blog/twitter-metrics/)

### Core Metrics to Track

#### 1. Impressions
**Definition**: Number of times your tweet was displayed across feeds, profiles, and search.

**Why it matters**: Baseline visibility metric. Shows how many people had the opportunity to see your content.

**What's good**: Varies by follower count, but track trends over time. Sudden drops indicate algorithm issues.

#### 2. Engagement Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of impressions that resulted in interaction (likes, RTs, replies, clicks, QTs).

**Why it matters**: THE metric that signals content quality to the algorithm. High engagement = more distribution.

**How to improve**: Focus on replies (highest value) and quote tweets (second highest).

#### 3. Profile Visits
**Definition**: How many people clicked through to view your profile.

**Why it matters**: Indicates interest beyond single tweet. Strong signal for follower conversion.

**What drives it**: Compelling bio, pinned tweet, consistent content quality.

#### 4. Follower Growth Rate
**Definition**: Net new followers over time.

**Why it matters**: Shows audience-building momentum.

**Calculation**: (New followers - Unfollows) / Total followers × 100

**Healthy rate**: 5-10% monthly for growing accounts.

#### 5. Video Metrics (Critical in 2025)
- **View rate**: % of impressions that resulted in video plays
- **Retention rate**: Average % of video watched
- **Completion rate**: % who watched to the end

**Benchmark**: 25%+ completion rate is strong.

#### 6. Link Clicks (if applicable)
**Definition**: Clicks on URLs in your tweets.

**Why it matters**: Measures content's ability to drive traffic.

**Note**: External links are deprioritized, so track CTR not just reach.

#### 7. Reply Rate
**Definition**: Replies per post.

**Why it matters**: Strongest algorithmic signal. Shows conversation value.

**Target**: Any reply rate >0.5% is strong. 2%+ is exceptional.

### Access Changes in 2025

**Important**: X now gates analytics access:
- **Account-level dashboards**: Require Premium (desktop only)
- **Post-level metrics**: Free access via mobile app

**Workaround**: Use third-party tools like Brand24, Hootsuite, or Buffer for comprehensive free/basic analytics.

**Source**: [Sociality.io Analytics Guide](https://sociality.io/blog/twitter-analytics/)

### Metrics That DON'T Matter (Much)

1. **Follower count** (without engagement)
   - "A million followers mean nothing if only 5 people care what you post"

2. **Likes alone** (lowest algorithmic weight)
   - Passive signal, minimal distribution impact

3. **Total tweets** (quantity over quality)
   - Algorithm doesn't reward volume

### What to Optimize For

**Priority ranking:**
1. **Engagement rate** (especially replies + QTs)
2. **Video retention** (if using video)
3. **Profile visit rate** (indicates interest depth)
4. **Follower growth rate** (sustainable momentum)
5. **Impressions** (reach baseline)

**Action step**: Set up weekly analytics reviews. Track trends, not just absolute numbers.

## 10. Common Mistakes and Emerging Trends

### Common Mistakes to Avoid in 2025

#### 1. No Clear Content Strategy
**Mistake**: Posting inconsistently without theme or purpose.

**Impact**: Confuses followers, prevents audience alignment, wastes effort.

**Fix**: Define 3-5 content pillars. Create content calendar. Stick to themes.

#### 2. One-Dimensional Content
**Mistake**: Only posting one type of content (e.g., only quotes, only promotions).

**Impact**: Audience fatigue, low engagement, poor algorithmic performance.

**Fix**: Mix educational, entertaining, personal, and promotional content using the 80/20 rule.

**Source**: [Sendible Mistakes Guide](https://www.sendible.com/insights/21-common-mistakes-on-twitter-to-avoid)

#### 3. Inconsistent Posting Schedule
**Mistake**: Batch posting (10 tweets at once) then disappearing for days.

**Impact**: Algorithm penalizes inconsistency. Audience forgets you.

**Fix**: Spread posts evenly. 1-3 tweets daily beats 20 tweets on Monday then silence.

#### 4. Over-Automation
**Mistake**: Using bots to auto-tweet or auto-reply.

**Impact**: Looks spammy, reduces authenticity, violates platform norms.

**Fix**: Schedule posts but engage manually. Authenticity can't be automated.

#### 5. Buying Followers
**Mistake**: Purchasing followers for vanity metrics.

**Impact**: Fake followers don't engage, tank your engagement rate, damage credibility.

**Fix**: Grow organically. 100 real followers > 10,000 fake ones.

**Source**: [Medium Small Account Mistakes](https://medium.com/illumination/7-twitter-x-mistakes-that-hurt-small-accounts-b4f37dcf86a8)

#### 6. Ignoring Engagement
**Mistake**: Posting content then never responding to replies or mentions.
