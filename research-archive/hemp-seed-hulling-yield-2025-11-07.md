### 10.2 Commercial Purchasing Decisions

**Cost Considerations:**
- Whole hemp seeds are typically 40-60% cheaper per pound than hulled
- However, effective cost per pound of edible kernel is similar
- Additional costs: Processing time, equipment, waste disposal

**When to Buy Whole vs. Hulled:**
- Buy hulled for: Food products, dietary supplements, immediate consumption
- Buy whole for: Planting, birdseed, whole seed nutritional benefits, long-term storage

### 10.3 Storage Implications

**Shelf Life Considerations:**
- Whole seeds: 1-2 years (hull protects kernel from oxidation)
- Hulled seeds: 3-6 months (oils exposed to air, prone to rancidity)
- Refrigerated hulled seeds: Up to 1 year
- Frozen hulled seeds: Up to 2 years

**Storage Recommendation:**
- Purchase whole seeds for long-term storage
- Hull in batches as needed for optimal freshness
