---

#### **2. Direct Messages (DMs) - Highly Personal**

**Declining Effectiveness:**
- Static landing pages lack personalization
- Platforms hide external links in algorithmic feeds to keep users in-app

- Multi-link landing pages (Linktree, Stan Store, etc.)

**Hybrid Recommendation:**
- Use bio for evergreen resources

---

### Why Comment-to-DM Outperforms

**Algorithmic Advantage:**
- High engagement (comments) signals platform algorithms to boost content reach
- Creates virtuous cycle: more visibility → more comments → more leads

**Psychological Advantage:**
- People "raise their hand" before receiving outreach (warmer leads)
- Feels like permission-based marketing vs. interruption marketing
- Reduces friction (no leaving platform to fill forms)

**Personalization Advantage:**
- Enables tailored messaging per segment
- Supports conversational qualification
- Can deliver different resources based on comment keywords

---

### Why Link in Bio Is Declining

**Platform Incentives:**
- Instagram/TikTok hide external links to keep users in-app
- Algorithm penalizes content designed to drive traffic off-platform

**User Experience Issues:**
- Extra friction (click bio → click link → fill form)
- Static pages lack personalization
- One-size-fits-all approach misses segment-specific messaging

**Recommendation:** Reserve link in bio for evergreen homepage/portfolio, use DM strategies for campaigns.
